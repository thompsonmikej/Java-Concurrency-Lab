# Java-Concurrency-Lab

**Developed at devCodeCamp**

A hands-on Java console application demonstrating concurrency concepts, focusing on race conditions within critical sections. The lab explores how multiple threads accessing and modifying shared data can cause inconsistencies, and offers methods for resolving these issues.

---

## Description

This project introduces Java concurrency by simulating race conditionsâ€”bugs that occur when two or more threads attempt to modify shared data simultaneously. You'll see first-hand how unpredictable results arise inside critical sections and learn to resolve them using synchronization.

---

## Features

- Practice writing Java methods for mathematical calculations
- Simulate race conditions and critical sections
- Demonstrate resolution with thread synchronization
- Console-based output for immediate feedback

---

## Technologies Used

- Java
- IntelliJ IDEA

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Java-Concurrency-Lab.git
    cd Java-Concurrency-Lab
    ```
2. **Open in IntelliJ IDEA or your preferred Java IDE.**
3. **Build and run the project.**

---

## Usage

- Run the program in your IDE or terminal.
- Observe the effects of multiple threads operating on shared data.
- Experiment with and without synchronization to see the difference in output consistency.
